# hangman
Just a simple console game in Python - wrote to learn basics of this language. 

Game in Polish.
In file 'lista.txt' you have the list of words grouped in categories, from which game chooses the password. 
In game there are 3 difficulty levels. You need to guess the letters in password and if you make 6 mistakes the game is lost - you hang.
The stats are exported to file 'stats.txt' where you can check your number of played games, right and wrong guesses etc.
